        <dt>Running</dt>
        <dd>I love running a lot during my freetime, but recently I've slowed down on running because I have been trying to gain some weight. I'm also on the track & field team for Brooklyn Tech.</dd>
        <dt>Volleyball</dt>
        <dd>I love play volleyball specifically receiving with my friends because my receives are usually better than my sets and spikes. I'm not particularly skilled at volleyball but manageable enough to have fun while playing it. </dd>
        <dt>Cooking</dt>
        <dd>I recently picked up cooking and following recipes online, I manage to make good meals. I would say that I think I am skilled enough to make my own meals and satisfy my taste buds but for everyone not just yet.</dd>
